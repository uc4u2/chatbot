Introduction
Product research is critical for identifying profitable products in the competitive e-commerce market. AliExpress-Scraper automates the process by fetching product data from AliExpress (via RapidAPI), filtering it based on key criteria (minimum orders, rating, and maximum price), and exporting the results to an Excel file. This tool is designed for beginners—no UI or advanced programming needed. Simply run the script using Windows PowerShell to get your Excel report.

System Requirements
Operating System: Windows 10 or later
Software:
Python (latest version recommended)
Microsoft Excel (or a free alternative like LibreOffice Calc)
Windows PowerShell (pre-installed on Windows)
Internet Connection: Required to fetch data from the AliExpress API
Getting Started
Project Structure
Your project folder should look like this: C:\Aliscraper └── backend ├── scraper.py ├── RunScraper.ps1 └── README.md

Setting Up the Environment
Create Project Folders:

Create a folder named Aliscraper on your C: drive.
Inside, create a subfolder named backend.
Set Up a Python Virtual Environment:

Open Windows PowerShell and navigate to the backend folder:
cd C:\Aliscraper\backend
Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
Your prompt should now show (venv).
Installing Dependencies
With the virtual environment activated, install the required libraries:

pip install flask requests pandas flask-cors openpyxl

Note: Although Flask and flask-cors are installed for potential future expansion, this project uses Python and PowerShell only.

Usage
Running the Scraper Manually
Open Windows PowerShell.
Navigate to the backend folder:
powershell

cd C:\Aliscraper\backend
Activate the Virtual Environment:
powershell

.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
Run the Python Script:
powershell

python scraper.py
Check the Output:
The script logs messages in PowerShell and creates an Excel file named winning_products.xlsx in the backend folder.
Scheduling the Scraper with PowerShell
Create a PowerShell Script File:
Save the following content as RunScraper.ps1 in your C:\Aliscraper\backend folder:
powershell

cd C:\Aliscraper\backend
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python scraper.py
Schedule the Task Using Windows Task Scheduler:
Press Win + R, type taskschd.msc, and press Enter.
Click Create Basic Task… and follow these steps:
Name: "Run AliExpress Scraper"
Trigger: Set your desired schedule (e.g., daily or every few hours).
Action: "Start a Program"
Program/Script: powershell.exe
Add Arguments:
powershell

-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Aliscraper\backend\RunScraper.ps1"
Finish and save the task. The scraper will run automatically according to the schedule.
How It Works
The AliExpress-Scraper script follows these steps:

Data Extraction:

Uses the RapidAPI endpoint for AliExpress to fetch product data for multiple search queries.
Iterates through pages and collects product details such as name, price, orders, and rating.
Data Filtering:

Applies winning criteria:
Minimum orders: 5
Minimum rating: 4
Maximum price: $30.0
Sorts the filtered (winning) products in descending order by the number of orders.
Data Export:

Converts the filtered product list into an Excel file (winning_products.xlsx) using Pandas and openpyxl.
Troubleshooting
API Errors:
Verify that your API key is correct.
Check that you are within the allowed rate limits.
Python Errors:
Ensure all required libraries are installed.
Make sure your virtual environment is activated.
PowerShell Issues:
Confirm that the paths in your scripts are correct.
Ensure you are running PowerShell with the appropriate execution policy.

Step-by-Step Guide: Building a Chatbot with FastAPI (Backend) & React (Frontend using Vite)
This guide will walk you through the full process of setting up the chatbot, from backend (FastAPI) to frontend (React with Vite). It includes all PowerShell (PS) / Command Prompt (CMD) commands needed to run, debug, and update your chatbot in the future.

1️⃣ Backend Setup - FastAPI
We'll start by setting up the chatbot API with FastAPI.

1.1 Install Python & Create Virtual Environment
powershell
Copy
Edit
# Move to the backend folder
cd C:\chatbox\chatbox-backend\chat-engine

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv env

# Activate the virtual environment (PowerShell)
env\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# (If using CMD)
env\Scripts\activate.bat
1.2 Install Dependencies
powershell
Copy
Edit
pip install fastapi uvicorn openai python-dotenv
1.3 Create app.py
Create a file named app.py in chatbox-backend/chat-engine/ and add the following code:

python
Copy
Edit
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
import openai
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load API Key
load_dotenv()
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

app = FastAPI()

class ChatRequest(BaseModel):
    user_id: str
    message: str

@app.post("/chat")
async def chat(request: ChatRequest):
    try:
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": request.message}]
        )
        return {"reply": response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Chatbot is running!"}
1.4 Create .env file
Create a .env file in the same folder as app.py and add:

ini
Copy
Edit
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
1.5 Run the Backend
powershell
Copy
Edit
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
✔ Backend is now running on: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

1.6 Test the API
Run this in CMD or PowerShell:

powershell
Copy
Edit
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"user_id\": \"123\", \"message\": \"Who is Yousef?\"}"
If successful, you’ll receive a chatbot response. ✅

2️⃣ Frontend Setup - React (Vite)
We'll now set up the chatbot's UI using React with Vite.

2.1 Install Node.js & Create Vite App
powershell
Copy
Edit
# Move to frontend folder
cd C:\chatbox\chatbox-frontend

# Create Vite project
npx create-vite@latest chatbox-frontend --template react

# Move into the project folder
cd chatbox-frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install
npm install axios
2.2 Create ChatBox.jsx
Inside src/components/ChatBox.jsx, add:

javascript
Copy
Edit
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";

export default function ChatBox() {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([
    { role: "bot", content: "Hello! How can I help you today?" },
  ]);
  const [input, setInput] = useState("");
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

  const sendMessage = async () => {
    if (!input.trim()) return;

    const newMessages = [...messages, { role: "user", content: input }];
    setMessages(newMessages);
    setInput("");
    setLoading(true);

    try {
      const response = await fetch("http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
        body: JSON.stringify({ user_id: "123", message: input }),
      });

      const data = await response.json();
      setMessages([...newMessages, { role: "bot", content: data.reply }]);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error:", error);
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };
